# 👋 Hi, I'm Pedro!

A passionate and detail-oriented Junior Web Developer with a strong foundation in building responsive web applications. Recently requalified through the [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/) full-stack bootcamp, where I focused on clean architecture, accessibility, and seamless UI experiences. I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing strong communication, adaptability, and a sharp eye for translating designs into pixel-perfect code. 

If you enjoy web apps with a dash of creativity and a sprinkle of code wizardry, you’re in the right place... I'm about building interactive web experiences with JavaScript, React and CSS with a touch of Node, Express and a lil bit of SQL.
